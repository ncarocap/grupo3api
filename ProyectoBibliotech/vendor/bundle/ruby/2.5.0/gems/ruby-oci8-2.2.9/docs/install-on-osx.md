Install ruby-oci8 on OS X
=========================

This page explains the way to install ruby-oci8 os OS X.

Look at {file:docs/install-full-client.md}, {file:docs/install-instant-client.md}
or {file:docs/install-binary-package.md} for other platforms.

Install C compiler
------------------

You need to install the command line developer tools or the Xcode.
(The latter includes the former.)

Run `"cc --version"` in a terminal to check whether they are installed.

If the cc version is printed, the tools are installed.

If the follwoing dialog is displayed, click its Install button to
install the tools.
You have no need to install the Xcode to compile ruby-oci8.
It requires command line tools, not an IDE such as the Xcode.

If `"Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges,
please re-run as root via sudo."` is printed, you need to run
`"sudo cc --version"`, enter your password, look at the license
and type `"agree"`.
